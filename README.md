# Cakephp filesystem placing awesome!

Hello! 
In this repository, I offer several methods of file location projects.
Convenient sharing of projects code and CakePHP libraries allow you to quickly update and develope your applications.
Was the introduction of separation "/tmp" from "app/" and added a directory "/data/".
Thus the following is obtained:
```javascript
dir                  const
Application-dir/
  /app               APP_DIR
  /data              APP_DATA
  /tmp               TMP
```
